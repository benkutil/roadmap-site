An age old battle. How to muster end of day energy to log time. We know tracking and entering time can be painful, if not monotenuous. **We want to make that easier.**

Today, we’ve taken the _beta_ wraps off **[Odometer](//time.ppmroadmap.com)**, our companion time logger for Roadmap.

We see Odometer as more than a time logger. Odometer maps out a new design and development process for us as a company. During Odometer’s development we:

- updated our technology stack
- shortened our feedback cycles between design, development, and customers validation/feedback. 
- proved the flexibility of Roadmap’s new design system.

## Green Fields

We love working in Odometer’s technology stack. We’ve separated the technologies that handle the interface from storage and logic. Using [Ember](http://emberjs.com) and Roadmap’s API, we can easily structure and test our code, ensuring you have a fast, consistent experience using Odometer. This _[separation of concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns)_ makes developing native applications and more advanced interfaces easier in the future.

## Flat Circles

In the past, our development cycles followed traditional, outdated processes. _Write large requirement docs. Design from the requirements. Send “over the fence” to development._ No More!

During Odometer’s development, design and development worked on the same codebase, reviewing pull requests and feature stories. We tested our initial sketches and mockups with customers, getting instant feedback to incorporate into the next iteration.

We can't wait to continue these tight feedback loops as we begin working on the next version of Roadmap.

## Pretty Pictures

We’ve begun the process of re-engineering Roadmap, focused on your weekly or daily use of Roadmap. Odometer showcases the new design language at the heart of our Next Version of Roadmap (NVR).

I'm excited to share with you a few screens from NVR's design process.

### Bringing People Into Roadmap

We addressed Roadmap’s onboarding process first, removing as much friction as possible for a person.

### Putting People Front And Center

The new detail pages for team members, clients, and assets showcases the experience they bring to a project.

### Find Anything

Search plays a key Role in Roadmap’s future. Quickly act on the project components important to you.
