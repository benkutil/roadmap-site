Those with contributing access can update the website through github.

The easiest way to update the [News](https://ppmroadmap.com/updates/) portion of the site is to use [Prose.io](http://prose.io).

This will allow you to connect your github account to prose, and use their simple markdown editor to publish pages to the site.

Once connected, you'll get a list of repositories that you have access to.

From the righthand site, select the **getroadmap** organization, then select the **roadmap-site**.

By default, youâ€™ll be editing directly on the "Master" branch, which publishes to the live site. If you want to test your post first, navigate to the "Develop" branch, which publishes to the github pages url. You can do this on the right hand side.

From there, you can select "New Post", and edit the post like you would a github ticket, using markdown.
